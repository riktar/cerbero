# Installation

### Install

Cloning the repo and in the root folder launch

```bash
npm install
```

### Start

**DISCLAIMER:** By default, Prego is configured to use HTTP portocol, so the service listens on port 80, make sure that this port is avaiable.

In the root folder launch

```bash
sudo npm start
```

... and you are done!
